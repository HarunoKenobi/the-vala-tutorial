# Classes

```vala
class ClassName : SuperClassName, InterfaceName {
}
```

defines a class, i.e. a reference type. In contrast to structs, instances of classes are heap allocated. There is much more syntax related to classes, which is discussed more fully in the section about object oriented programming.
