# Comments
Vala allows comments to be recorded in code in different ways. 

```vala
// Comment continues until end of line

/* Comment lasts between delimiters */

/**
 * Documentation comment
 */
```

These are handled in the same way as in most other languages and so need little explanation. Documentation comments are actually not special to Vala, but a documentation generation tool like [Valadoc](/Projects/Valadoc) will recognise them.
