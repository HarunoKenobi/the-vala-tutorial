# Creating a Library

### Using Autotools

It is possible to use Autotools to create a library written in Vala. A library is created by using C code generated by Vala compiler, linked and installed as any other library. Then you need tell which C files must be used to create the library and which of them must be distributable, allowing others to compile a tarball without Vala using standard Autotools commands: **configure**, **make** and **make install**.

### Compilation and linking using Command

Vala is not yet capable of directly creating dynamic or static libraries. To create a library, proceed with the `-c` (compile only) switch and link the object files with your favourite linker, i.e. `libtool` or `ar`.

    $ valac -c ...(source files)
    $ ar cx ...(object files)


or by compiling the intermediate C code with *gcc*

    $ valac -C ...(source files)
    $ gcc -o my-best-library.so --shared -fPIC ...(compiled C code files)...
