# Using Autotools

It is possible to use Autotools to create a library written in Vala. A library is created by using C code generated by Vala compiler, linked and installed as any other library. Then you need tell which C files must be used to create the library and which of them must be distributable, allowing others to compile a tarball without Vala using standard Autotools commands: **configure**, **make** and **make install**.
