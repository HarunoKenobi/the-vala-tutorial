# Conventions

Code will be in `monospacedÂ text`, commands will all be prefaced with a \\$ prompt. Other than that, everything should be obvious. I tend to code very explicitly, including some information that is actually implied. I will try to explain where some things can be omitted, but that doesn't mean that I encourage you do to this.
