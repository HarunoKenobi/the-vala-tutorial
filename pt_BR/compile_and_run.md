# Compile and Run

Assuming you have Vala installed, then all it takes to compile and execute this program is: 

    $ valac hello.vala
    $ ./hello

*valac* is the Vala compiler, which will compile your Vala code into a binary. The resulting binary will have the same name as the source file and can then be directly executed on the machine. You can probably guess the output.
