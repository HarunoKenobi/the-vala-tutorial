# What is Vala?

Vala is a programming language that allows modern techniques to be used to write applications that run on the GNOME application stack, particularly GLib and GObject. This platform has long provided a very complete programming environment, with such features as a dynamic type system and assisted memory management. Before Vala, the only ways to program for the platform were with the machine native C API, which exposes a lot of often unwanted detail, with a high level language that has an attendant virtual machine, such as Python or the Mono C\# language, or alternatively, with C++ through a wrapper library.
